# Task

#### To-Do’s API:

Design and implement a CRUD service in nodeJS for a to-do list app that will support:

- signing up with email and password,
- signing in (login),
- getting the user’s todo list,
- adding new todo items,
- mark items as done,
- delete items. 
- Data should be stored in a DB

#### Nice to have:

- add support for gRPC API
- Docker file to run the server and the database
- Use nestJ framework
- API documentation with tools such as swagger
- Tests
- A front end UI
- Create a technical design document based on the above requirements
  
#### Notes:

- upload code to git or send as a zip file.
- include a clear README file that will describe how to build and use the API
- Make it possible to for us to run the project with minimum setup (Ex: docker-compose)
